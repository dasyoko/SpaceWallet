## Challenge

How would the economy work on New Earth?

## Our Creation

Given the fact that there would be different nationalities on this New Earth, we need a uniformed currency and wallet application in order to better serve the new citizens. 

We wanted to explore new tech like the blockchain, so we built a very basic proof of concept ledger based on that idea. 

Our wallet app can send and receieve funds, check for jobs on the New Earth, and it provides data visualization to the wallet owner based on what they buy and spend.
